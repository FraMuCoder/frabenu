# frabenu - Framebuffer Menu

frabenu is a simple linux program that shows a graphical menu and returns the choice in a script friendly way.

## Motivation

After preparing my Raspberry Pi with Kodi and RetroPie, I wished to have a menu to choose between
Desktop, Kodi, RetroPie or just the shell.
I found a shell script that works, but I had a graphical menu in my mind
that can be controlled by keyboard and gamepad.
Nothing I found matched my wishes, so frabenu was born.

## Implementation

frabenu is mostly based on fbida (https://www.kraxel.org/cgit/fbida/) (GPL-2.0+).
